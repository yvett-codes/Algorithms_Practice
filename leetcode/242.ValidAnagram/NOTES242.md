## Goals
<!-- Describe your goals to solve this problem. -->
Given two strings, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other. If the two strings are not, we return false. In order for the strings to be anagrams, the words needs to be formed using all of the letters of the original word exactly once.

## Big O

### Time Complexity
1. Identify data structures which can have variable size.
    <br>

2. Identify all the operations (steps) in the algorithm.
    <br>

3. Recognize which operations depend on the size of the data structure of size *n*.
<br>

4. Create an equation that represents how many operations get performed and use *n* as a variable.
<br>

5. Drop all constants and find the dominant term.
<br>

6. Match this to the most relevant complexity.
<br>


### Space complexity:
1. Identify all places where a variable is initialized.
    <br>

2. Recognize which variables have a value that could take a variable amount of memory.
<br>

3. Create an equation that represents how many values are initialized and stored in memory.
<br>

4. Drop all constants and find the dominant term.
<br>

5. Match this to the most relevant complexity.
